For the past few months, I've been a part of a development team that is running an Agile framework as its workflow.

During this time, I've had the privelege of serving as a ScrumMaster for my Scrum team.
As part of my learning experience, I've been reading "The Scrum Field Guide" by XXX with a group of my peers.

The following are just a few of the things that I've learned along the way:


### Core Ideas
- Communication
- Team Dynamics
- Trust accross all parties

### Easy to understand, difficult in practice





### What is the true measure of success?
As my mentor, Fred Ball likes to say: "The true meassure of success for a dev team is working software".





### Experience trumps the classroom
While reading articles and books on Agile practices is good and essential towards developing a solid understanding of
best practices, I believe that the best lessons are thought through experience.

Every team is different, and problems faced by one team may require a different solution for another team. Being able
to accurately and confidently lead your team through these issues will require you to be able to adapt to the unique
needs of the team, and the understanding for how best to implement whatever solutions your team comes up with, will have
to be driven by experience with the team.

It takes time to become a "good Scrum Master", and much like how choosing to be a software developer as a career
requires you to have the mindset of a life-long student, I believe that good scrum masters are those that are able to
continually adapt and learn to fit what's best for the team to what the customer needs. 
A good Scrum Master is one that is Agile (pun completely intended).
