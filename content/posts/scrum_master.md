For the past few months, I've been a part of a development team that is running an Agile framework as its workflow.
If you are not familiar with Agile or Scrum, I would encourage you to browse through some of the following articles:

- "The Scrum Papers" by Jeff Sutherland



During this time, I've had the privelege of serving as a ScrumMaster for my Scrum team.
As part of my learning experience, I've been reading "The Scrum Field Guide" by XXX with a group of my peers.

Here are just a few of the things that I've learned along the way, given from the perspective of someone who's
background is a developer:


### Core Ideas
These are some of the core ideas that I've begun to internalize within myself and within the team:

- Communication \
Any type of relationship must be centered around communication. Open communication across team members will help
decrease risk factors pertaining to project variables and unknowns. Consistent and frequent feedback loops between the
dev team and the customer will help reduce unwanted surprises and help keep the project on track. Clear release plans
and team capabilities extrapolated from past velocities and capacities gives managements peace of mind (which reduces
stress on everybody else).

- Accountability
A team that is openly communicating with each other helps keep each team member accountable to each other.
Accountability ensures that commitments and promises are kept, and release milestones are met.


- Trust accross all parties
Given the above two conditions are met, it follows naturally that trust begins to develop across not just the team
members, but with the customer and management as well. 
As a fundamental building block in any relationship, trust between the dev team and the customer ensures the integrity
of the feedback loop, which is pivotal for iterative development.




- Team Dynamics / Morale

- Adaptability
- Engineering best practices





### Easy to understand, difficult in practice
What may makes sense for one team member, may not be so clear to another.



### What is the true measure of success?
As my mentor, Fred Ball likes to say: "The true meassure of success for a dev team is working software".


### It's a full-time job
During my time as a Scrum Master, I was also splitting my time as a developer. While this was fine for the first few
sprints, as our team began to understand Agile and 

Of course, some teams are going to require more work than others,





### Have a support group 
As with learning anything, I think that the most effective (and fun) ways of understanding any new material is through
discussions with others. 




### Experience trumps the classroom
While reading articles and books on Agile practices is good and essential towards developing a solid understanding of
best practices, I believe that the best lessons are thought through experience.

Every team is different, and problems faced by one team may require a different solution for another team. Being able
to accurately and confidently lead your team through these issues will require you to be able to adapt to the unique
needs of the team, and the understanding for how best to implement whatever solutions your team comes up with, will have
to be driven by experience with the team.

It takes time to become a "good Scrum Master", and much like how choosing to be a software developer as a career
requires you to have the mindset of a life-long student, I believe that good scrum masters are those that are able to
continually adapt and learn to fit what's best for the team to what the customer needs. 
A good Scrum Master is one that is Agile (pun completely intended).
