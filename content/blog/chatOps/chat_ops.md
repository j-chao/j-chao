The way we communicate has changed over the yaers, and today, it's no secret that millennials are spending more time
texting than they are talking with phones.

According to a study by
[OpenMarket](http://www.openmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/millennials-text-rather-than-talk.jpg), 
75% of millennials would forego the call function on their device as long as they were still able to text. 
A another [study](https://www.openmarket.com/press/study-millennials-would-rather-text-than-talk-infographic/) 
gives a few reasons as to why people are beginning to prefer texting over calls:

- texting is more convenient and fits with individual schedules better
- texting is less disruptive to everyday life than voice calling

In a similar manner, I think that the methods by how we communicate within the office and with our teammates is bounded
by very similar principles and constraints. We are seeing more and more usages of chat services in our workplaces,
such as Jabber, Slack, and Flowdock. 

But can we do better?


### ChatOps?
[Sean Regan from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/software-teams/what-is-chatops-adoption-guide), 
defines ChatOps as a collaboration model that connects people, tools, process, and automation into a transparent workflow.
It is a way to connect work needed, the work happening, and the work done in a persistent location that integrates with
tools, and is managed by people across all roles.

This centralization of all aspects of a project provdes a level of transparency and accountability that would otherwise
be difficult to accomplish. In turn, these values improve feedback loops between the dev team and the business, improves
information sharing across the team, and ultimately imcreases team dynamics.

Best of all, this aggregation of tools and processes revolves around, and is driven by conversation: the foundational
force that propels teamwork and progress.
