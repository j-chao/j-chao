For the past few months, I've been a part of a development team that is running an Agile framework as its workflow.
If you are not familiar with Agile or Scrum, I would encourage you to browse through some of the following articles:

- "The Scrum Papers" by Jeff Sutherland


During this time, I've had the privilege of serving as a Scrum Master for my Scrum team.  As part of my learning
experience, I've been reading "The Scrum Field Guide" by Mitch Lacey with a group of my peers.

Here are just a few of the things that I've learned along the way, given from the perspective of someone who's
background is a developer:


# Core Ideas
These are some of the core ideas that I've begun to internalize within myself and within the team:

#### Communication \
Any type of relationship must be centered around communication. Open communication across team members will help
decrease risk factors pertaining to project variables and unknowns. Consistent and frequent feedback loops between the
development team and the customer will help reduce unwanted surprises and help keep the project on track. Clear release plans
and team capabilities extrapolated from past velocities and capacities gives managements peace of mind (which reduces
stress on everybody else).

#### Accountability \
A team that is openly communicating with each other helps keep each team member accountable to each other.
Accountability ensures that commitments and promises are kept, and release milestones are met.


#### Trust across all parties \
Given the above two conditions are met, it follows naturally that trust begins to develop across not just the team
members, but with the customer and management as well. 
As a fundamental building block in any relationship, trust between the development team and the customer ensures the integrity
of the feedback loop, which is pivotal for iterative development.


#### Team Dynamics / Morale \
If the relationship between the team, management, and customer is positive, then we can expect the team's morale to
increase as well. A happy team with happy people results in an increase in team velocity and its ability to get work
done. 


#### Adaptability \
As a corollary to the above, a team must be able to adapt to changing business needs or team dynamics.
Situations such as the addition of a new business need, a change in a release timeline, or a change in team members, can
be detrimental to the team's morale if the team does not know how to actively adapt to the change, and can result in a
loss of trust and communication across all parties.
Some solutions to common issues that often plague teams can include any of the following:
     - a return to Agile fundamentals, ensuring that everyone on the team knows what to expect and why.
     - a re-inspection of how the team is calculating its velocity, sprint length, release planning timelines, user story
       points, or "definition of done".
     - an exploration into using team consultants to support the core team when new or challenging unknowns present
       themselves.
     - the adoption of engineering best practices



# Easy to understand, difficult in practice
The above core ideas may seem obvious to some, but actual implementation of them can be difficult to see.
As creatures of habit, it can be difficult to change once we've been set down a path or specific mindset.
Many times, as we walk further down a path, our vision begins to narrow and we can lose sight of the bigger picture.

The reason why Agile and Scrum can be so difficult to implement, is because it requires a shift in mindset, which often
results in changes occurring as well. Moreover, these changes are often not just limited to the development team, but can
affect how the team interacts with management and the customer as well.

Finally, there is no "one, right way" for how a team should implement Agile, since all teams are different. There is not
an answer book that a team can follow. Instead, the team must be able to find what works best for themselves, and the
only way to do that is to have a solid understanding of the underlying values that Agile expresses. 


# Have a support group 
As with learning anything, I think that the most effective (and fun) ways of understanding any new material is through
discussions with others. Having a group of peers who share your same ideas and values, can provide you with a wealth of
differing perspectives from different experiences and teams. Maybe you'll even find a solution that works better for
yourself, based off of what someone else is doing!
Besides, it never hurts to have a sounding board where you can vent your frustrations whenever challenges threaten your
implementation of Agile :smile:.



# Experience trumps the classroom
While reading articles and books on Agile practices is good and essential towards developing a solid understanding of
best practices, I believe that the best lessons are thought through experience.

Every team is different, and problems faced by one team may require a different solution for another team. Being able
to accurately and confidently lead your team through these issues will require you to be able to adapt to the unique
needs of the team, and the understanding for how best to implement whatever solutions your team comes up with, will have
to be driven by the experience that comes with working with the team.

It takes time to become a "good Scrum Master", and much like how choosing to be a software developer as a career
requires you to have the mindset of a life-long student, I believe that good Scrum Masters are those that are able to
continually adapt and learn to fit what's best for the team to what is asked of the team.
A good Scrum Master is one that is Agile (pun completely intended).
